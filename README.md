<h1>Top K Frequency</h1>

<h2>Frequency Analyzer</h2>
<p>The <strong>Frequency Analyzer</strong> is a Java program that analyzes an array of integers to identify the top K numbers with the highest occurrences. It prioritizes numbers based on frequency and, in the case of ties, selects the larger number. Results are presented in descending order of frequency.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Static Variable</strong>: Stores the input array of integers.</li>
  <li><strong>Static Method</strong>: Implements frequency analysis and sorting logic to determine the top K numbers.</li>
  <li><strong>Sorting Logic</strong>: Ensures numbers are sorted by frequency first, then by value in descending order.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Set the static array <code>numbers</code> with your desired integers.</li>
  <li>Call the <code>findTopKFrequentNumbers(K)</code> method with a positive integer K to retrieve the top K frequent numbers.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>For the array <code>{7, 10, 11, 5, 2, 5, 5, 7, 11, 8, 9}</code> with <code>K = 4</code>, the output will be:</p>
<pre><code>5 11 7 10</code></pre>
